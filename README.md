Catalog description: This course introduces students to the modern computational approaches and governing physical and chemical principles that underpin structure-based drug discovery. The course explores how biomolecular structure and dynamics inform the rational design of therapeutics and how machine learning can be harnessed to improve drug discovery. Topics include molecular interactions, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, molecular simulations, coarse-grained and enhanced sampling techniques, free energy calculations, protein structure prediction, protein design, molecular docking, and virtual screening. Students will engage with methods for structure-based drug discovery in hands-on assignments and recitations.
